You can now configure the default type of tag that is inserted (see README).
Extension now also works if you have an empty selection.
`"html.autoClosingTags": true` will no longer result in duplicate closing tags being inserted.

Special thanks: Spoofardio. Other PRs are being reviewed and more updates are to come.
